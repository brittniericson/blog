In honor of Valentine’s Day, I’m starting out my blogging adventures with a 3 part mini series featuring a *mouthwatering dark chocolate cupcake, filled with chocolate raspberry ganache, and topped with a chocolate covered strawberry.*

So today I want to share one of my favorite cupcake tricks with you, chocolate cupcake liners. Yes, I took out the paper liner, and made them out of chocolate instead, because paper is not nearly as tasty as chocolate!

To start you’ll need to gather a few supplies:

I purchased my silicon cupcake liners from [amazon] (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00JR39AUM/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o06_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1/ "amazon") and I absolutely **love** them! Cupcakes pop right out of them, they’re easy to clean, and they come in a variety of pretty colors. These are going to act as a mold for our chocolate liners.  

Start by pouring your candy melts into a microwave safe bowl. Microwave the chocolate on high in 30 second intervals, stirring in between, until all the chocolate is melted. Be careful here because chocolate can go from smooth and creamy, to burnt and lumpy in just a few seconds! I like to stir in about a tablespoon of vegetable shortening to the melted chocolate. I find that this helps to get the cupcake liners thinner and smoother and you won’t taste a difference.

Using the back of a small spoon, begin to paint chocolate on the inside of the silicon liners. Coat the entire inside with just enough chocolate so that you cannot see through to the liner anymore. Once you have a nice coating all around, tap the liner on the counter a few times until all the air bubble and brush strokes begin to disappear. 

Once you have finished painting chocolate in all of your molds, place them on a foil or silpat lined baking sheet and pop them into the freezer until set. 

At this point, if you can still see through to the silicon, your chocolate liners are too thin and it will be too difficult to remove from the silicon mold. You can simply add another coat of chocolate with a food safe paintbrush. Let the chocolate liners come to room temperate and repeat the steps above. 

As soon as the chocolate has set up, remove them from the freezer. *Gently* begin to peel back the silicon liner from the chocolate. Start from the top and slowly work your way around. After the top edge is loosened the rest should pop right out! 

Check out the video below for a step-by-step visual. In my next post, I will share with you how I used these liners to make my favorite chocolate cupcakes!
