Today is one of the most exciting days of my life. The past three years has been all about change, and I mean *BIG* changes. In 2012 I graduated college. Later that same year my wonderful husband, Greg, proposed. In 2013 I officially moved to Alexandria and began working in DC. In September of 2014, Greg and I got married and then just two months later I launched Ericson Cupcakes, my in home cupcake business. Today is moving day. Today is finally the day when we move out of our tiny, but wonderful, one bedroom apartment that we have called home for the past two years. This tiny apartment has seen the entirety of our wedding planning process and all my DIY adventures and I will miss it very much. Now at this point I’m sure most of you are trying to figure out why on earth after graduation and a wedding that this tiny move is one the most exciting days of my life?? It’s because this move for me signifies an opportunity to grow. To grow our family, to grow my business and to grow ourselves. So without further ado, here are some before shots of our new townhome! Excuse all the mess and stay tuned as I share all the adventures of filling it with memories.
