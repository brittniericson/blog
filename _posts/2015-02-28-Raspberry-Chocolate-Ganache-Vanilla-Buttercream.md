This is the final piece to my chocolate cupcake obsession mini-series!  If you missed the Part 1 post on how to make chocolate cupcake liners feel free to read [here] ({{ site.baseurl }}/cakes/holidays/crafts/2015/02/14/Chocolate-Cupcake-Liners/ "Part 1") or the Part 2 post on dark chocolate Guinness cupcakes read [here] ({{ site.baseurl }}/cakes/holidays/2015/02/21/dark-chocolate-cupcakes/' "Part 2").

To finish up these cupcakes I’m going to show you how to make a *raspberry ganache filling* and a *fluffy vanilla buttercream icing*.

<div class="pretty" style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.25em">Chocolate Raspberry Ganache</div>

Let’s start by gathering a few ingredients for the raspberry ganache.

Chop the chocolate up finely and place in a heatproof bowl. Place the heavy cream in saucepan and cook over medium heat, continuously stirring, until simmering. Pour hot cream over the chocolate and let sit for one minute. Stir the cream and chocolate from the outside in until smooth. Add the butter and raspberry extract and stir till combined. Let the ganache set up until thickened but still soft enough to pipe.  

Once the ganache has set up, place it into a gallon bag and cup a corner off for easy piping.

There are a few different tools to use to fill your cupcakes. I use a Wilton cupcake corer that is pictured below. However I have also in the past used a 1M  cake tip.  Core the center of all of your cupcakes and then remove them from the silicon liners and place them into the chocolate liner. Finish by filling them will the ganache.

The key to nice fluffy buttercream is beating the butter *really well*! So start by beating both the salted and unsalted butter for about 15 minutes. You’ll know the butter is done when it turns from yellow to white. Slowly add in the powdered sugar until you’ve reached a thick icing consistency.  Add the vanilla extract and heavy cream and mix until well combined.

I used a 2D tip for the cupcakes pictured because I wanted a nice ruffly look for my Valentines Day treat but you can use whatever tip you choose. This icing is best served pretty quickly after it made because it’s so light and fluffy when its fresh. However it’s still pretty tasty the next day! 

I hope you enjoyed this series. Please feel free to comment with questions or pictures of your tasty creations!
