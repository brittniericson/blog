Welcome to part 2 of this 3 part mini-series!  If you missed the Part 1 post on how to make chocolate cupcake liners feel free to read [here] (hhttp://127.0.0.1:4000/blog/cakes,/holidays,/crafts/2015/02/14/Chocolate-Cupcake-Liners/ "post 1").

Today I’m going to share my absolute favorite cupcake recipe with you. I cannot take credit for this delicious treat as I first discovered it [here] (http://www.browneyedbaker.com/irish-car-bomb-cupcakes/ "origional recipe"). Her recipe starts out with a Guinness cupcake that is absolutely amazing, so good that I pretty much use it as my go to chocolate cupcake recipe. The Guinness gets cooked out so in the end you have a very rich smooth cupcake that has more of a dark chocolate flavor than most recipes. 

Since we are going to use our chocolate cupcake liners for this cupcake, be sure to bake your cupcakes in the silicone liners. You could use paper here but I find that sometimes paper can stick and pull pieces of the cupcake apart. 

Start by gathering your ingredients:

Preheat your oven to 350° and line your cupcake pan with your silicon liners or set them directly onto a lined baking sheet. Place the Guinness and butter in a saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Carefully add the cocoa powder to the mixture and whisk until smooth. Set the mixture aside to cool slightly.

Sift the flour, sugar, baking soda and salt and set aside. Beat the eggs and sour cream with an electric mixer until combined and smooth. Slowly pour in the Guinness mixture (the butter may have started to separate here and that is ok) and continue mixing until combined. Turn the speed down to low and carefully add the dry ingredients and mix just until combined. Divide batter into your silicone liners. If you are like me and only have 12 liners, you will have to make these in two batches. Bake for about 17 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center of your cupcakes comes out clean. Place the cupcake, still in the liners, on a rack to cool. One the cupcakes are completely cool, you can slowly and carefully peel off the cupcake liners.

Next week I will show you how to make a raspberry ganache, a fluffy buttercream and simple chocolate covered strawberries to finish off these chocolate cupcakes!
