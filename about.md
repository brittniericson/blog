I am first and foremost a designer. I love problem solving and I live for the opportunity to think outside of the box. I have an Interior Design degree from Radford University and currently work as a geospatial manager for the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, DC. On the side, I run an in home cupcake business, Ericson Cupcakes, specializing in sugar flowers and edible cupcake decorations.</p>

The beautiful watercolor graphics in the sidebar (the social media icons and categories buttons) are 
from <a href="http://www.angiemakes.com" class="text-muted"><i>www.angiemakes.com</i></a>. She makes some of the most beautiful graphics and I would highly 
recommend checking out her website!</p>

My entire website was custom made for me by my very talented husband, Greg Ericson. If you are
