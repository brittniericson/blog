I am first and foremost a designer. I love problem solving and I live
for the opportunity to think outside of the box. I have an Interior Design degree from Radford 
University and currently work as a geospatial manager for the Smithsonian Institution. On the 
side, I run an in home cupcake business, Ericson Cupcakes, specializing in sugar flowers and 
edible cupcake decorations.

I am a wife to Greg and mommy to two kitty cats, Jack and Taz. My three amazing boys. We 
live in the wonderfully eclectic city of Alexandria, Virginia. 

I am constantly filled to the brim with big ideas. Ideas on home design projects, ideas on the 
next great party to plan, ideas on cupcake decorations. My goal with this blog is to turn all these 
ideas into reality and share them with you.

I believe that all great things start from a tiny spark of inspiration and I want to share all of my 
inspiration with you! So kick your feet up, take a look around and I would love to hear from you!

The beautiful watercolor graphics in the sidebar (the social media icons and categories buttons) are 
from <a href="http://www.angiemakes.com" class="text-muted"><i>www.angiemakes.com</i></a>. She makes some of the most beautiful graphics and I would highly 
recommend checking out her website!

My entire website was custom made for me by my very talented husband, Greg Ericson. If you are
